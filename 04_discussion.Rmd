# Discussion

Discussion points:

-   *Something here about subject to change based on:*

1.  *Changes to irec:*
    -   *calibration 2.0,*

    -   irec *QA/QC process not finalized*

-   Modelling:

    -   We would expect a non-linear relationship in the modeling of 2005-2012 iREC inclusion since the y axis involves filtered creel and the x axis is only unfiltered creel. The creel filtration process is likely non-linear since smaller estimates are more likely to not pass the quality control filter.
